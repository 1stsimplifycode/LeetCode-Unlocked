# Minimum Size Subarray Sum 
Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r-1], nums[r]] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= target <= 10^9
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

### Examples
```javascript
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

## Approaches to Solve the Problem
### Approach 1: Brute Force (Inefficient)
##### Intuition:
In the brute-force approach, we consider every possible subarray in the array. For each subarray, we compute its sum and check if it meets or exceeds the target. We track the minimum subarray length.

Steps:
1. Use two nested loops to consider all subarrays.
2. For each subarray, calculate its sum.
3. If the sum is greater than or equal to the target, update the minimum subarray length.
4. Return the minimum length found.
##### Time Complexity:
O(n²), where n is the length of the array. This approach checks every subarray.
##### Space Complexity:
O(1), as no extra space is used beyond variables for tracking the subarray sum and length.
##### Python Code:
```python
def minSubArrayLen(target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    min_len = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_sum += nums[j]
            if current_sum >= target:
                min_len = min(min_len, j - i + 1)
                break
    
    return 0 if min_len == float('inf') else min_len
```
### Approach 2: Sliding Window (Optimal Solution)
##### Intuition: 
The brute-force approach is inefficient because we are recalculating the sum for every subarray from scratch. We can improve this by using the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window (a subarray) with two pointers, left and right, and dynamically adjust the window size as we traverse the array.

Start by expanding the window by moving the right pointer until the window’s sum is greater than or equal to the target.
Once the window's sum is valid, shrink the window by moving the left pointer inward to minimize its size while keeping the sum greater than or equal to the target.

Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers left and right at the start of the array.
2. Maintain a running sum of the elements in the window.
3. Expand the window by moving right and adding the current element to the running sum.
4. If the sum is greater than or equal to the target, update the minimum length and move the left pointer 5.inward to try and shrink the window.
5. Repeat until right reaches the end of the array.
##### Visualization:
```perl
For target = 7 and nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]:

Initial state: left = 0, right = 0, sum = 0

Step 1: Expand the window
    right = 0, sum = 2

Step 2: Expand the window
    right = 1, sum = 5

Step 3: Expand the window
    right = 2, sum = 6

Step 4: Expand the window
    right = 3, sum = 8 (valid window), update min_len = 4, shrink window from left

Step 5: Shrink window
    left = 1, sum = 6

Step 6: Expand the window
    right = 4, sum = 10 (valid window), update min_len = 2

Step 7: Shrink window
    left = 2, sum = 7 (valid window), update min_len = 2

Step 8: Shrink window further until left = 3, then exit.
```
##### Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the array. We traverse the array once with the sliding window.
##### Space Complexity:
O(1), as no extra space is used beyond the sliding window and a few variables.
##### Python Code:
```python
def minSubArrayLen(target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_len = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        # Shrink the window while sum is greater than or equal to target
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
    
    return 0 if min_len == float('inf') else min_len
```
#### Edge Cases:
1. Target larger than the total sum: If the sum of all elements in nums is less than target, the function should return 0.
2. Single element array: If the array has only one element, the function should handle this case properly by checking if the element is greater than or equal to the target.
3. All elements are smaller than target: If all elements are smaller than the target, the algorithm should correctly identify the minimal subarray that meets the condition.
## Summary
| Approach                         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Brute Force	                    | 	O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Sliding Window (Optimal)	                          | O(n)            | O(1)             |

The Sliding Window approach is the most efficient solution. It processes the array in linear time and adjusts the window dynamically, making it the optimal solution for this problem.
