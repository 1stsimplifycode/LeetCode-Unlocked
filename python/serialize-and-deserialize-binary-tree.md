# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

You need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized back into the original tree structure.

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- The value of each node is in the range [-1000, 1000].

### Examples
```javascript
Input:
     1
    / \
   2   3
      / \
     4   5

Output: "1,2,null,null,3,4,null,null,5,null,null"
```

## Approaches to Solve the Problem
### Approach 1: Preorder Traversal with Recursion (DFS)
##### Intuition:
The binary tree can be serialized using pre-order traversal (root, left, right). In this approach:

- During serialization, we traverse the tree, and for each node, we add its value to the string. For null nodes (i.e., missing children), we add a special marker like "null".
- During deserialization, we use the serialized string to reconstruct the tree by consuming the nodes in pre-order sequence, creating a node for each value and recursively building its left and right subtrees.

Steps:
1. Serialization:
   - Traverse the tree using pre-order traversal.
   - Append node values to the result list, and for null nodes, append "null".
   - Convert the result list to a comma-separated string.
2. Deserialization:
   - Split the serialized string into a list of values.
   - Rebuild the tree recursively by consuming values in pre-order.
   - Create nodes for non-null values and use recursion to construct the left and right subtrees.
##### Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Both serialization and deserialization visit each node exactly once.
##### Space Complexity:
O(n), for storing the serialized string and the recursion stack during deserialization.
##### Python Code:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string."""
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                result.append("null")
            else:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                dfs(node.left)
                dfs(node.right)

        result = []
        dfs(root)
        return ','.join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree."""
        def dfs():
            val = next(values)
            if val == "null":
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        values = iter(data.split(','))
        return dfs()
```
### Approach 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
##### Intuition:
We can also use level-order traversal (BFS) to serialize and deserialize the binary tree. This approach handles null nodes explicitly and encodes the tree level by level.

- Serialization: Traverse the tree level by level and record each node’s value. If a node is null, record "null".
- Deserialization: Use a queue to reconstruct the tree level by level. Start with the root and enqueue its children, using the serialized values to determine whether to insert a child or leave it as null.

Steps:
1. Serialization:
   - Use a queue for level-order traversal.
   - For each node, add its value to the result list. If the node is null, add "null".
2. Deserialization:
   - Use a queue to rebuild the tree level by level.
   - Start with the root, and for each node, create its left and right children based on the serialized values.
##### Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of nodes. We visit each node exactly once during serialization and deserialization.
##### Space Complexity:
O(n), for the queue used during BFS and for storing the serialized string.
##### Python Code:
```python
from collections import deque

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string."""
        if not root:
            return "null"
        
        result = []
        queue = deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append("null")
        
        return ','.join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree."""
        if data == "null":
            return None
        
        values = data.split(',')
        root = TreeNode(int(values[0]))
        queue = deque([root])
        index = 1
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if values[index] != "null":
                node.left = TreeNode(int(values[index]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            index += 1
            
            if values[index] != "null":
                node.right = TreeNode(int(values[index]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            index += 1
        
        return root
```
### Explanation of Code:
1. Serialization (BFS):
We start by adding the root node to the queue and traversing the tree level by level. If a node is null, we append "null" to the result list. Otherwise, we append the node’s value and add its children to the queue.
2. Deserialization (BFS):
We begin by creating the root node from the first value in the serialized data. Using a queue, we iterate through the serialized data, reconstructing the tree level by level by assigning left and right children to each node.
### Edge Cases
1. Empty Tree: If the input tree is empty (root == None), the serialized result should be "null", and deserialization should return None.
2. Single Node Tree: A tree with a single node should serialize to just the value of the root, and deserialization should reconstruct that single node correctly.
3. All null Nodes: A tree with only null nodes at a certain depth should serialize all those null values explicitly.
### Summary
| Approach                         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Preorder Traversal (DFS)			      | O(n)      | O(n)             |
| Level-Order Traversal (BFS)				      | O(n)      | O(n)             |

Both the DFS and BFS approaches achieve the same time and space complexity, visiting each node once during serialization and deserialization. The choice between the two approaches depends on the preference for traversal strategy, though DFS is often more straightforward in recursive problems like this one.
